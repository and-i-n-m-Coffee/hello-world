# hello-world
This is the beginning of my journey into the world of coding. 
Greetings Everyone!

My username and-i-n-m-Coffee discribes me pretty well because I need more coffee at any given time.
I enjoy learning new things, being challenged by tasks that I once thought impossible to accomplish before, and helping others when I can. I am excited to learn a new skill that will help me develop a new career and help me support my loved one.
